The files in this folder are original structure files for the examples to test the algorithm. The structures are given in .sdf format (CTAB V2000)

The structures whose names start with a letter are examples used for testing the function of calculating minimal RMSD. Structures with the same starting letter are the same molecules with different conformations.

The structures whose names start with 'stereochemistry' are examples used for testing the function of generating stereochemistry tags of molecules according to CIP rules. The molecules have already been canonized.
